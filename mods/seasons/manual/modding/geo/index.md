# GEO mods


Do not put Realismus Modding as author of the mod. You can add us as contributor, if we contributed. Also make sure you use the proper XML in your modDesc. For examples, look at our own GEO mods.
It is preferable to call the zip name `FS17_GEO_<area>`. Do not put `RM` in there.

If you upload your GEO mod to modhub, make sure to look at the testing document. Also, make sure you supply a screenshot of the growth overview in the Seasons menu.
