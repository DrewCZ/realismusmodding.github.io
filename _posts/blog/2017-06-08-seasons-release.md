It is an amazing feeling to finally have v1 of Seasons ready to release after 7 months of hard work and many laughs and frustrations. What a great journey with many twists and turns and now finally seeing all of the features working seamlessly together makes me feel proud of what we have achieved.

But it does not mean that we are ready to hang up our hats. There is still so much more that we are planning to include in future versions of the mod and I am excited and privileged to be a part of this.
