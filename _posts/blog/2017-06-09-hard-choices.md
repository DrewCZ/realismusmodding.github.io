To give some insight into the choices you will be faced with using our mod I'll tell a little bit about my singleplayer game. I've been using it for play testing throughout the development.

It is now winter, and I'm soon starting year 3. Playing on hard and with no cheats which means small scale. Got two arable fields and two grass fields, in addition to a dairy operation with now 39 cows. Arable is a nice income, but the fields are not that big, although I need the straw for my cows. Season length is 9 days and game speed is at 5x constant. I never go to 1x to give myself more time. In most cases I get to sleep at night though.

My main focus is to maximise productivity of the cows as this gives me more income than arable annually if I do it right. Last winter I had 30 cows and I had enough animal feed. I am wondering how things will work out this winter as I have 30% more animals. I'm facing two challenges: 1) Do I have enough straw for bedding, and 2) enough hay and silage? Even if I pull it through this winter, I won't be able to cut grass until late spring, and fresh supply of straw won't be before I harvest the arable in late summer at earliest. Buying animal feed is quite expensive also.

##### Planning the future
In the even longer term I'm wondering in what to invest. Next summer, my cows will give birth and my livestock increase in numbers. If I increase it further I probably need to have another grass field. Then I also need more straw. Or I could invest all my money in arable, keeping the dairy operation at the limit of what my grass fields can sustain.

Next is investments in machinery. I am mainly running a MF 5613 that is picking up hours very quickly. This means more expensive maintenance and if I expand into arable I really need a bigger tractor. I should buy a manure spreader and slurry tank this spring, but should I buy machinery that fits the MF now. That might not be wise considering I really want a bigger tractor. Hmm. Maybe just rent for another year then as I rarely use that equipment.

As you see from the picture above, I have now started to cut down timber as I really need more money. I am not sure how much I will manage to cut during this winter as I can't afford to hire a Ponsse. Using only chain saw and a small winch on the tractor. Then there was a quite heavy snow fall so I had to spend time clearing the yard. Was nearly finished, when even more snow came.

This is exactly what I wanted from this mod. It gives the gameplay the depth I'm looking for. It is not always given what is the best way of spending the money. Frankly I'm fed up cleaning after the animals and feeding them. I need to clean every day (meaning I've done that like 70 times now) and I'm feeding approximately every second day. But this is what farming is about. Some work you just have to do. However, the mod gives variability as every season is different. Now in winter I am looking forward to spring, with longer days, better weather, seeing trees and crops sprout. Working in the forest in the dark hours of winter is hard labour.
